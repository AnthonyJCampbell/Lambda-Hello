My name is Anthony J. Campbell from the Netherlands. At birth, I was called Jibbe van Buul.

Three words to describe me: ambitious, restless, tough.

To be completely honest, I don't really have a hobby that would qualify. Not in the traditional sense. That doesn't mean I don't have multiple interests, though; I read pretty much all day, be it in books or on the internet, I write on a daily basis, I'm in the gym six times a week to do powerlifting and bodybuilding, and I have spent an inordinate amount of time on Star Wars, Halo and Warhammer 40k wikis
My favorite place in the entire world is a small spot near the river Meuse, about two miles from my home in Rosmalen, the Netherlands. It's a small rocky breakwater, some 1,000 feet away from the bridge. At sunset, the sun dips under the bridge and bathes the entire river bank in a smooth redish-orange glow. During summers, I often go there to think, write or meditate.
